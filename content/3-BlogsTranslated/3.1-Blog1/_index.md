# Rox accelerates sales productivity with AI agents powered by Amazon Bedrock

*by Santhan Pamulapati, Andrew Brown, Santhosh Kumar Manavasi Lakshminarayanan, Shriram Sridharan, and Taeuk Kang on 01 OCT 2025 in Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Machine Learning, Customer Solutions*

This post was co-written with Shriram Sridharan, Taeuk Kang, and Santhosh Kumar Manavasi Lakshminarayanan from Rox.

**Rox** is building a new revenue operating system for the applied AI era.

Modern revenue teams rely on more data than ever before, such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, marketing automation, finance systems, support tickets, and live product usage. Though each serves its role, together they create silos that slow sellers down and leave insights untapped.

Rox addresses this by providing a **revenue operating system**: a unified layer that brings these signals together and equips AI agents to execute go-to-market (GTM) workflows. Instead of reconciling reports or updating fields, sellers get real-time intelligence and automation in their daily flow.

Today, we’re excited to announce that Rox is generally available, with Rox infrastructure built on AWS and delivered across web, Slack, macOS, and iOS. In this post, we share how Rox accelerates sales productivity with AI agents powered by [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/).

## Solution overview

As noted in *Rox is transforming revenue teams with AI-driven integration powered by AWS*, modern GTM teams need more than a static database. Revenue data spans dozens of systems, such as product usage, finance, and support, and teams require a system that unifies context and acts on it in real time.

Rox delivers this through a layered architecture on AWS:

* **System of record** – A unified, governed knowledge graph consolidates CRM, finance, support, product telemetry, and web data.
* **Agent swarms** – Intelligent, account-aware agents reason over the graph and orchestrate multi-step workflows like research, outreach, opportunity management, and proposal generation.
* **Interfaces across surfaces** – Sellers engage these workflows where they work, such as web application, Slack, iOS, and macOS.

This converts the CRM from a passive system of record into an active system of action, so teams can act on their data immediately and intelligently.

The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.

## Benefits and features of ROX

Now generally available, Rox extends from intelligence to full execution with **Command**, a new conversational interface that orchestrates multi-agent workflows. Command coordinates with multiple specialized agents running in parallel.

A single request (for example, “prep me for the ACME renewal and draft follow-ups”) expands into a plan:
1.  Research usage and support signals
2.  Identify missing stakeholders
3.  Refresh enrichment
4.  Propose next-best actions
5.  Draft outreach
6.  Update the opportunity
7.  Assemble a proposal

Each step is completed through tool calls into your systems and is subject to guardrail approvals. Our comprehensive safety architecture employs a sophisticated multi-layer guardrail system as the first line of defense against inappropriate, harmful, or malicious requests. Incoming requests undergo rigorous analysis through our advanced filtering mechanisms before reaching the inference layer. This preprocessing stage evaluates multiple dimensions of safety and appropriateness, such as legal compliance assessment and business relevance evaluation, to make sure only legitimate, safe, and contextually appropriate requests proceed to model execution.

Command decomposes the request, routes steps to the right agents, sequences external tool invocations (CRM, calendar, enrichment, email), reconciles results into the system of context, and returns one coherent thread that’s ready for consumption on the web, Slack, iOS, or macOS. Every suggestion is **explainable** (sources and traces), **reversible** (audit logs), and **policy-aware** (role-based access control, rate limits, required approvals).

## How Amazon Bedrock powers Rox

Command demands a model capable of reasoning across multiple steps, orchestrating tools, and adapting dynamically.

To meet these needs, Rox chose **Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 on Amazon Bedrock**. Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 has consistently demonstrated unmatched tool-calling and reasoning performance, allowing Rox agents to sequence workflows like account research, enrichment, outreach, opportunity management, and proposal generation with reliability.

Amazon Bedrock provides the foundation to deliver Rox at enterprise scale, offering security, flexibility to integrate with the latest models, and scalability to handle thousands of concurrent agents reliably.

### Additional Features

In addition to Command, Rox includes the following features:

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Research** | Offers deep account and market research, grounded in unified context (carried over from private beta) |
| **Meet** | Makes it possible to record, transcribe, summarize, and turn meetings into actions (carried over from private beta) |
| **Outreach** | Provides personalized prospect engagement, contextualized by unified data (new) |
| **Revenue** | Helps you track, update, and advance pipelines in the flow of work (new) |
| **Auto-fill proposals** | Helps you assemble tailored proposals in seconds from account context (new) |
| **Rox apps** | Offers modular extensions that add purpose-built workflows (dashboards, trackers) directly into the system (new) |

## Early customer impact

In beta, enterprises saw immediate gains:
* **50%** higher representative productivity
* **20%** faster sales velocity
* **Twofold** revenue per rep

For example, real Rox customers were able to sharpen their focus on high-value opportunities, driving a **40–50% increase in average selling price**. Another customer saw **90% reduction in rep prep time** and faster closes, plus **15% more six-figure deals** uncovered through Rox insights. Rox also shortens ramp time for new reps, with customers reporting **50% quicker ramp time** using Rox.
