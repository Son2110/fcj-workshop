### [Event 1](4.1-Event1/)
&emsp;**Event Name:** Vietnam Cloud Day HCMC Connect Edition (GenAI & Data Track)

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 08:30, September 26, 2025

&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee

&emsp;**Description:** This was a major event about cloud technology, and I chose to join the track focused on GenAI and Data. Speakers from AWS and partners (like TymeX) shared the importance of building a "Unified Data Foundation" to feed AI. I learned about breaking down data "silos" (isolated storage) and using Amazon Bedrock to build AI apps quickly without worrying too much about the complex infrastructure underneath.

&emsp;**Outcome:** I really internalized the idea that "Data is fuel for AI" – if the data isn't clean and organized, the AI won't be smart. I learned about the Zero-ETL trend, which helps reduce the tiring work of moving data around manually. The real-world case study from TymeX in the finance sector gave me confidence that GenAI isn't just a trend; it actually solves real business problems.

### [Event 2](4.2-Event2/)
&emsp;**Event Name:** AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1: AI/ML/GenAI on AWS

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 08:30, November 15, 2025

&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee

&emsp;**Description:** An introduction to the big AI models (Foundation Models) and Generative AI using Amazon Bedrock. The speakers explained how to write good prompts (using a technique called Chain of Thought) and explained RAG architecture, which helps AI use our own internal data. We also looked at vector embeddings and got an overview of the different AWS AI services.

&emsp;**Outcome:** I learned a lot about how to stop AI from making things up (hallucinations) by using RAG and Embeddings. I learned which AWS AI service to use for different problems. The event gave me some good insights into building AI agents and was a great chance to listen to experts in the field.

### [Event 3](4.3-Event3/)
&emsp;**Event Name:** AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2: DevOps on AWS

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 08:30, November 17, 2025

&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee

&emsp;**Description:** A complete look at the "DevOps mindset," focusing on teamwork and automating everything. We covered essential services like CI/CD pipelines, "Infrastructure as Code" (using code to build servers) with CloudFormation, and container management using EKS. They also shared a helpful "Do's and Don'ts" list for beginners starting a DevOps journey and tips on how to monitor systems properly.

&emsp;**Outcome:** I got a clearer roadmap for a career in DevOps and understood the software life cycle better. I learned why automating things with code (IaC) helps avoid human mistakes. I also gained insights into keeping systems healthy through monitoring, thanks to the demos from the experts.

### [Event 4](4.4-Event4/)
&emsp;**Event Name:** AWS Cloud Mastery Series #3: AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 08:30, November 29, 2025

&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee

&emsp;**Description:** A deep dive into keeping things safe on AWS, covering Identity, Infrastructure, and Data protection. We looked at foundational security steps like permissions and MFA, but also explored advanced strategies like "Detection-as-Code" to find threats automatically using code and setting up automated responses.

&emsp;**Outcome:** I learned why it's important not to give everyone full access (the principle of least privilege) and how to enforce it effectively. I picked up some practical skills on setting up automatic alerts when something looks suspicious. It really highlighted that in security, prevention is better than cure to minimize risks.
