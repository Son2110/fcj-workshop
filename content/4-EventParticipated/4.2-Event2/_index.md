# Summary Report: "AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1: AI/ML/GenAI on AWS"

### Event Objectives

- Understand the basic concepts of Foundation Models.
- Learn Prompting techniques to optimize output results.
- Explore the capabilities of Generative AI through the Amazon Bedrock service.
- Learn about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture and how to integrate a Knowledge Base.

### Speakers

- **Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi**
- **Lam Truong Kiet**
- **Dinh Le Hoang Anh**

### Key Highlights

#### Prompting Techniques

- **Prompt Optimization**: Understood the importance of drafting clear and specific prompts to ensure the AI model returns more accurate results.
- **Chain of Thought**: A method of guiding the AI to process problems step-by-step, helping to improve logical reasoning capabilities.

#### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

- **Expanding AI Capabilities**: Understood how to combine AI with the enterprise's internal data sources instead of relying solely on pre-trained data.
- **Accuracy and Real-time**: RAG helps minimize "hallucinations" (AI fabricating information) and ensures answers are always updated with the latest information.

#### Vector Embeddings

- **Data Representation**: How to convert text into numerical vectors so computers can understand semantics and relationships between words.
- **Capturing Context**: Embedding models help the system understand the nuances of the text.
- **Multilingual**: The ability to compare and search for semantic similarities across different languages.

#### AWS AI Services

- **Amazon Rekognition**: Image and video analysis.
- **Amazon Translate**: Automatic translation.
- **Amazon Textract**: Data extraction from scanned documents.
- **Amazon Transcribe**: Speech-to-text conversion.
- **Amazon Polly**: Text-to-speech conversion with natural voices.
- **Amazon Comprehend**: Text and sentiment analysis.
- **Amazon Kendra**: Intelligent search engine for enterprises.
- **Amazon Lookout**: Anomaly detection in data.
- **Amazon Personalize**: Personalized recommendation system.

### Key Takeaways

#### Improving Prompting Skills

- **Providing Context**: Giving specific examples (few-shot prompting) helps the AI understand the request better.
- **Detailed Instructions**: Explaining the processing workflow step-by-step to the AI to solve problems.

#### RAG Applications

- **Minimizing Errors**: Connecting to the enterprise's verified knowledge sources.
- **Enhancing Chatbots**: Integrating real-time data to make Chatbots respond more intelligently.
- **Personalized Search**: Based on user history and personas.
- **Data Summarization**: Extracting information from transactional documents.

#### Amazon Titan Embeddings

- **Semantic Search**: Allows searching based on the meaning of keywords rather than just character matching.
- **Performance**: Supports processing large token counts and diverse languages.

### Plan for Application

- **Further Research**: Continue to explore AI services more deeply to evaluate their applicability for future projects.
- **Experimentation**: Start practicing the prompting techniques learned to improve work efficiency.
