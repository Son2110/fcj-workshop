# Summary Report: "AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2: DevOps on AWS"

### Event Objectives

- Understand what the "DevOps Mindset" actually is.
- Get to know AWS services for DevOps and CI/CD pipelines.
- Learn about "Infrastructure as Code" (IaC) - controlling things with code.
- Explore Container services on AWS.
- How to check if the system is healthy (Monitoring & Observability).
- Hear real-world tips and "battle stories" from the experts.

### Speakers

- **Truong Quang Tinh**
- **Nghiem Le**
- **Long Huynh**
- **Quy Pham**

### Key Highlights

#### DevOps Mindset

- **Collaboration is key**: Devs and Ops need to work together and share responsibility, not blame each other.
- **Automate everything**: If you have to do it twice, write a script. Don't do it by hand.
- **Keep learning**: Tech changes fast, so we have to keep learning and trying new things.
- **Measurement**: You need data/numbers to know if you are doing well or not.

#### The DevOps Journey (For beginners)

- **Do:**
    - Start with the basics (Linux, Network...).
    - Learn by doing: Build real projects yourself.
    - Document everything you do.
    - Master one thing at a time, don't rush.
    - Improve soft skills (communication).

- **Don't:**
    - Stay in "tutorial hell" (watching videos without coding).
    - Blindly copy-paste code without understanding how it runs.
    - Compare your progress to others.
    - Give up when you hit a bug.

#### CI/CD Pipeline

- Understanding the app lifecycle: From coding, testing, reviewing, staging (pre-prod), all the way to real users (production).

#### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- **The concept**: Use code to manage cloud resources instead of clicking around in the console manually.
- **Automation**: Automatically create, update, and delete infrastructure to avoid mistakes.
- **Tools**: Terraform, OpenTofu, Pulumi.

#### Container Services on AWS

- Managing containers with Docker, Kubernetes, Amazon ECR, and Amazon EKS.
- **Amazon App Runner**: A really cool service to deploy web apps directly from code without worrying about servers or complex configs (great for newbies).

#### Monitoring & Observability

- Using best practices with **Amazon CloudWatch** and **Amazon X-Ray** to see if the system is running smoothly.

### Key Takeaways

#### DevOps metrics that matter

- Tracking deployment health.
- Making the system more flexible and stable.
- Ensuring the best user experience.
- Proving that the tech we use is worth the investment.

#### The "Continuous" in CI/CD

- Seeing the full picture of how a CI/CD pipeline flows from start to finish.

#### IaC in AWS

- Knowing how to use **Amazon CloudFormation** to create templates for infrastructure, so we don't have to build it manually every time.

### Applying to Work

- **Build a roadmap**: Plan my own career path in DevOps.
- **Try CI/CD**: Attempt to add an automated pipeline to my current project (stop manual deployments).
- **Make Templates**: Write infrastructure code templates to reuse later and reduce human errors.

### Event Experience

Attending the **“DevOps on AWS”** workshop was really eye-opening, almost like having a guide for my DevOps career path. Some memorable experiences included:

#### Learning from the Speakers
- Experts from FACJ shared very honest stories about their daily DevOps work.
- Got to see a live demo of system monitoring, which looked really professional.

#### Exploring CI/CD and IaC
- Understood how big companies update their software continuously using CI/CD pipelines.
- Learned how to write code to build infrastructure (using CloudFormation/CDK) instead of tweaking things by hand.

#### System Monitoring
- Learned more about setting up alerts and viewing dashboards, as well as the on-call process for handling incidents.

> Overall, this event gave me a full picture of the DevOps career. More importantly, I picked up some "best practices" on how to apply CI/CD and monitoring properly.
